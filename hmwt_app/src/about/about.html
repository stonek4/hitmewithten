      <h2>Vocab Cards v0.1.2</h2>
      <p>This app is meant to help users with spelling and memorization practice.  Currently Vocab Cards is in Beta
         stages, therefore it works fairly well, but I can't promise things wont change.  Please report any bugs found to
         info@vocabcards.com.  Since I am the sole developer of the project, I am just working on it as my time is
         available.  If you want to help, (no coding experience required) feel free to send an email to info@vocabcards.com or
         if you want to browse the open source code visit <a href="https://www.github.com/stonek4/hitmewithten">the GitHub
         page</a>.  Eventually a goal is to release this app on the Android Play Store.  There are no current plans to add advertisements or monetize the
         app, so enjoy it! </p>

      <p> The following is a list of recent changes: </p>

      <p> 8/10/2017 ~ v.0.1.0 - I added some more styles and made it so modals close when clicking on the overlay.
          I bumped the version so this is the first official beta release of vocab cards!
