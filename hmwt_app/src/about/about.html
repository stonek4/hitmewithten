      <h2>Vocab Cards v0.0.26</h2>
      <p>This app is meant to help users with spelling and memorization practice.  Currently Vocab Cards is in Alpha
         stages, therefore it is not reliable and there are no guarantees that data will be retained.  <s>Eventually
         there will be an export feature that will allow card data to be saved to a file</s> (There is now!!, but no import yet).  Please report any bugs found to
         info@vocabcards.com.  Since I am the sole developer of the project, I am just working on it as my time is
         available.  If you want to help, (no experience required) feel free to send an email to info@vocabcards.com or
         if you want to browse the open source code visit <a href="https://www.github.com/stonek4/hitmewithten">the GitHub
         page</a>.  Eventually a goal is to release this app on the Android Play Store.  There are no current plans to add advertisements or monetize the
         app, so enjoy it! </p>
